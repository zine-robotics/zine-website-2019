        Robot manipulators look fancy. Don’t they?
        <br><br>
        But, before robots are capable of doing tasks, they have to be created! Engineers get to take the credit for
        designing the robots to do what they are programmed for. Mechanical engineers are responsible for designing the
        robot’s structure, joint mechanisms, bearings, heat transfer characteristics, etc. As all types of engineers
        work together, they build a complete robot.
        <br><br>
        So how does one design a robot? We begin with a blueprint.

        Ok let's just call it a plan. [Pink panther doesn’t like blue] <br>
        Before getting the tools ready we have to plan on how to solve the problem at hand. Analysing the problem helps
        generate insights into what possible solutions there can exist. Once the plan is ready, we design the bot,
        choose parts & materials that we may need for the bot and run virtual simulations to test our theoretical
        design.

        Tested results are then validated using a physical prototype. <sup>[more on that later] </sup>

        There are many different parts and materials available for building bots or anything in general. We will be
        discussing a few to help you be familiar with the world of robotics.

        Mechanical Engg. is an integral part of robotics. It ranges from knowing why triangles are used in cardboard
        layers to finding a Planet’s surface gravity and terrain characteristics; to design a Space rover’s drive
        system. Because the whole world isn’t a simulation,

        [Pepe is looking at you Elon] we need a device which can interact with the environment and are called bots. Here
        we give you a basic introduction to Mechanical Engg. for robotics to jumpstart your curiosity.
        <br><br>
        Let's say we need a bot that can traverse across the field, how will we move the bot? For that, we need an
        actuator for our bot. Let's look into actuators.
