            If you are getting interested in robotics, you are going to need a lot of different types of batteries for
            different uses, you'll need to know how to use them and understand the various ratings and specs. There are
            primary, secondary batteries, there are Li-ion and Li-Po batteries and much more. Why do we need batteries?
            Answer is simple: imagine a world without batteries. All those portable devices we’re so dependent on would
            be so limited! We’d only be able to take our laptops and phones as far as the reach of their cables, making
            that new running app you just downloaded onto your phone fairly useless.

                style="width: 245 px; height: 200px;">
            And why so different types of batteries?
            <br>

            Imagine you want to make a simple circuit, say just a simple led on and off or you want to build a drone for
            a drone racing competition. How does it all get powered up? Yes, we need batteries for that. For different
            applications, you may need different properties of a power source say for turning led on and off you just
            need a 2V or 3V battery with low current rates but drones motors require high current rates with a larger
            voltage supply. So different types of battery chemistry affect their application. Let us first study how
            batteries work.

            We know that you have studied it all during your jee. Let's quickly revise it. A battery is a device that
            stores chemical energy, and converts it to electricity. All this is termed as electrochemistry and the
            system that underpins a battery is called an electrochemical cell. Each electrochemical cell consists of two
            electrodes separated by an electrolyte.

            <br>
            So where does an electrochemical cell get its electricity from? To answer this question, we need to know
            what electricity is. Most simply, electricity is a type of energy produced by the flow of electrons. In an
            electrochemical cell, electrons are produced by a chemical reaction that happens at one electrode and then
            they flow over to the other electrode where they are used
            <br>
            <br>
            Let’s now study some types of batteries.

                Primary batteries
            </div>
            Primary cells are the ones that cannot be recharged and have to be discarded after the expiration of the
            lifetime. There are no fluids in the cells hence it is also called dry cells.
            Alkaline batteries and dry cells are examples of primary cells.

            Do you remember the redox reaction for this cell? It is a Zinc-Carbon dry cell.

                Secondary batteries
            </div>
            These are rechargeable batteries that can be used again and again.
            Think of some examples of secondary batteries. Yes, Lead Storage batteries that are commonly used in
            automobiles and Nickel Cadmium batteries.
            <br><br>
            Let’s know about some secondary batteries. But before that let’s study glossary about batteries.
            <br><br>
            Specific Energy: The specific energy of a battery is a measure of how much energy a battery contains in
            comparison to its weight, and is typically expressed in Watt-hours/kilogram (W-hr/kg).

            Energy Density: The energy density of a battery is a measure of how much energy a battery contains in
            comparison to its volume, and is typically expressed in Watt-hours/liter (W-hr/l).
            <br><br>

            Specific Power: Specific power means how much power a battery can deliver in comparison to its weight.
            <br><br>

            Charge/Discharge efficiency: The Charge/Discharge efficiency is the ratio of the energy you can take out of
            a battery divided by the energy you put in.
            <br><br>

            Self-discharge rate: Batteries generate electricity due to a chemical reaction inside the cell. Ideally,
            this happens when it is connected to a device that needs power. However, the reaction could also happen at a
            smaller scale, when the battery’s electrodes are not connected. That means that the battery’s charge
            gradually reduces over time. This phenomenon is called self-discharge and the rate at which it happens is
            called Self-discharge Rate.
            <br><br>

            Nominal Cell Voltage: The average voltage a cell outputs when charged.
            <br><br>

            Cycle Life: The cycle life is the number of complete charge/discharge cycles that the battery is able to
            support before its capacity falls under 80% of its original capacity.
            <br><br>

            Capacity: Capacity of a battery is defined as the number of hours for which a battery can provide a current
            equal to the discharge rate at the nominal voltage of the battery.
            <br><br>
            Some commonly used batteries in robotics are:

                Lipo Batteries
            </div>
            <img src="./img/images/batteries/image5.jpg" class="img-responsive floating-image center">
            They are lightweight and have improved safety. However, their cost is high (30% average) as compared to
            lithium ions. Also, the energy density of Li-Polymer batteries compared to Li-Ion Batteries is quite less.
            They have an extremely low profile and have a lower chance of suffering from leaking electrolyte. But they
            are significantly more costly to manufacture, and they do not have the same energy density nor lifespan as a
            lithium-ion.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Li-Po batteries, it isn’t a liquid. Instead, Li-Po technology uses one of three forms: a dry solid, which
            was largely phased out during the prototype years of lithium polymer batteries; a porous chemical compound;
            or, a gel-like electrolyte. This allows the battery to have more flexible shapes. Its uses include mobile
            devices, power banks, very thin laptop computers, portable media players, wireless controllers for video
            game consoles, wireless PC peripherals, electronic cigarettes.

            - 3S=3 cells in series 1P= 1cell in parallel. So a 3s1p has a total of 3 cells in it. 3s2p would be 3 cells
            in series but each of those cells in series is made up of 2 cells connected in parallel. So a 3s2p pack
            would actually have 6 cells in it if you tore it apart.
            <br>
            - 11.1 v is the nominal voltage for this battery. It has 3 cells in series and the nominal voltage of 1 cell
            is 3.7 V. So, 3*3.7 = 11.1V
            <br>
            - A C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is discharged relative to its maximum capacity. A 1C
            rate means that the discharge current will discharge the entire battery in 1 hour. For a battery with a
            capacity of 100 Amp-hrs, this equates to a discharge current of 100 Amps. It is a 25C battery with a
            <b>capacity of 2200mAh</b> .
