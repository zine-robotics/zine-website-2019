		<h2>Multi Actuator Switch Mode Hydraulic System</h2>
		<em>About</em>
		<p>
			Current hydraulic systems involving multiple actuators and a single hydraulic power supply generally have poor efficiency. Using throttling valves to control multiple actuators requires meeting the highest pressure requirement and the total flow of all of actuators. When there is a large difference in the pressure requirement of the actuators, fluid throttling results in significant energy losses. The purpose of this project is to implement switch-mode control in a multi-actuator circuit and demonstrate the improvement in efficiency over a traditional hydraulic system with throttling valve control. This will reduce energy losses and result in improved efficiency for usage of multiple actuators with a single hydraulic power source.
This idea utilises the input from both the tank and the pump. Using varying amounts of fluid coming from both sources, we can create various pressure and flow values for different actuators and in the process increase the efficiency of the system by operating the actuators at their rated pressures and flows.
The usages of this project vary from heavy duty hydraulic cranes to hydraulic lifts. This new technology, once implemented on a larger scale in realistic applications, will reduce losses in hydraulic systems that depend on multiple actuators to function.
