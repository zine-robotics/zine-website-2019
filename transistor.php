        Imagine a machine that is as big as MNIT‚Äôs VLTC and all you could use it for is to send a text message to your
        friend , sounds absurd, right?
        <br><br>
        Well, that would be the case if transistors weren‚Äôt invented, so before you proceed further reading this blog on
        your phone/laptop don‚Äôt forget to thank the noble scientists at Bell Labs who invented it. Well, what exactly is
        a transistor? I know y‚Äôall know what a transistor is, it‚Äôs construction, it‚Äôs working, it‚Äôs characteristic
        diagrams and this knowledge might as well have fetched you a few
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image4.jpg" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        marks in JEE Mains. But that‚Äôs all, in theory, we at Zine love electronics and we have a sweet spot for
        transistors. So let‚Äôs get into the practical aspect of transistors.
        Let‚Äôs have a look at how transistors actually look like:
        <br><br>
        Here are a few types of transistors just for reference, we‚Äôll know more about them soon.
        <br> For a quick recap, here‚Äôs the schematic of transistors which you might have studied about earlier:
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image6.png" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        C stands for Collector, B stands for Base and E stands for Emitter.
        <br> Wondering how do these terminals ‚Äúactually‚Äù look? Well here is a diagram for reference (Note: Different
        types of transistors have different pin configurations so it‚Äôs better to go through their pinout schematic which
        is just a google search away before using them )
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image7.jpg" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        Did you notice the small protrusion from the transistor situated in the middle? Interestingly, this is called ‚Äú
        heat sink‚Äù and it helps dissipate excess heat off the transistor. Find out the purpose of the small circular
        hole in the middle and why it is circular? <br><br>
        Transistors are usually used for two purposes: As a switch and as an amplifier.
        <br><br>
        <h1>Transistor Switch</h1><br>
        Let's look at the most fundamental transistor-switch circuit: an NPN switch. Here we use an NPN to control a
        high-power LED:
        If you want to take a deeper dive into the working of transistors as a switch, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRVvUkK0U80">refer to this link</a>. <br>
        Apart from these examples, NPN transistors are indeed the most commonly used transistors, think about this and
        let us know your reasoning‚Ä¶ <br><br>
        <br><br>
        While a normal switch would require an actuator(you‚Äôll read more about actuators in later blogs) to be
        physically flipped, this switch is controlled by the voltage at the base pin. A microcontroller Input/Output
        pin, like those on an Arduino Development Board (The first crush of any robotics enthusiastü•∞), can be
        programmed to go high or low to turn the LED on or off.
        <br><br>
        Well, so now you got the idea of how transistors can be configured to act as a switch. So, it‚Äôs time for you to
        realize that this property transistor which allowed us to use it as a switch using electricity is the
        fundamental building block of any computer ever built. Earlier this switching mechanism was carried out by huge
        vacuum tubes and those were quite bulky so it was near impossible to design machines with high computing power.
        It seems like that when Howard Stark said ‚Äú I'm <strong>limited by the technology</strong> of my time‚Äù he was
        speaking about
        these bulky vacuum tubes. (If you didn‚Äôt get the reference, go watch Iron Man, nerds !).

        <br><br>
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image2.jpg" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        Speaking of huge sizes, do you know how many transistors are there in an intel i7 microprocessor? Well, there
        are *drumroll* 2.16 Billion transistors on an intel i7 -7700K processor.
        <br><br> Yes, that‚Äôs how tiny transistors have become, imagine you‚Äôd require 2.16 billion vacuum tubes just to
        play Cyberpunk 2077 without any frame drops.
        <br>
        Apart from acting as a switch, transistors are also used for amplification. Stop right here and introspect.
        Don‚Äôt you think transistors act like an overall controlling unit of the BEE üêù we talked about earlier? Imagine
        transistors analogous to neurons such that many neurons club together and make up the controlling unit
        (microprocessors) and transistors amplify too‚Ä¶.umm just like the
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image1.gif" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        brain...umm...amplifies the pain. C‚Äômon folks, stay strong. You‚Äôll surely find someone better in MNIT. Let‚Äôs
        focus on the amplification applications of transistors for now.
        <br><br>
        <h1>Amplifiers</h1>
        <br>
        Some of the most powerful transistor applications involve amplification: turning a low power signal into one of
        a higher power. Amplifiers can increase the voltage of a signal, taking something from the ¬µV range and
        converting it to a more useful mV or V level. Or they can amplify current,
        <img src="img/images/transistor/image3.jpg" class="img-responsive floating-image center"><br>
        useful for turning the ¬µA of current produced by a photodiode into a current of much higher magnitude.
