						<h3>Introduction to Aeromodelling</h3>
						<p> Aeromodelling can be described as the art of designing, building and flying miniaturized aircrafts (Be it powered or unpowered). 
                        So, kudos to you, you have been an aeromodeller since your childhood.

But the real question is why do we need to study this field, don’t we already have the best of aircrafts?
Aero-modelling has an increasing area of scope for the last decades. Aero-modeling may be utilized in many ways. 
Aero-modeling is a hobby as well as a profession.

						<h3>Manoeuvring</h3>
						<p>Ever wondered what would happen when you throw your first built paper plane, which is not controlled by you, 
                        there is no one sitting on it, and you just throw it?
Well, after you let go of that plane, it completely depends on the build of your plane how it goes, it will have to face various disturbances,
 and how your plane reacts to it depends on its design, and that reaction determines its stability.

						<h3>RC Plane DIY</h3>
						<p>
                        We have studied the physics and those lengthy theories, we have seen how the plane is controlled, 
                        but how about actually building one of those?
In this section we will build a Radio Controlled plane.

						<h3>Multirotor aircrafts</h3>
						<p>A multirotor is a rotor based aircraft with 2 or more lift generating rotors. 
                        The construction and control is easy for multirotors and are often used in remotely
                         controlled drones, and aerial vehicle projects, and are easily configurable to equip more weight carrying capacity or thrust to weight ratio.
